      <description>Ideja za smoker Kako sam već pisao u prvom postu tijekom prošle godine rodila se ideja da pokušam napraviti svoj smoker. Gledajući smokere i proučavajući tone videa koje sam pronašao na ovu temu zaključio sam da klasični smoker od metala ne mogu napraviti. Razlog tome je količina potrebnog alata ali i materijala. Naime da bi imali klasični smoker potrebno vam je metalno bure debljine 6mm u koje ide rešetka za meso i dodatno sa strane malo burence ili ložište koje također treba biti od bar 6mm debelog metala i navareno na veliko bure.</description>

      <description>Roštilj odnosno grill Roštilj za mene simbolizira ručak nedjeljom i obiteljsko okupljanje. Naravno i dobar dio nekakvih proslava je počeo ili završio roštiljanjem. Carsko, vratina, piletina, šnicle i ponešto povrća iznad žara uveseljavalo uvijek izaziva osmijeh na licu i pojačano izlučivanje sline. Sam čin loženja vatre i iščekivanja savršenog žara budi nešto praiskonsko u nama pa se u mom slučaju ne mali broj puta duže ložilo nego peklo :) Dim i okus pečenog mesa i povrća meni je bio ne zamjenjiv.</description>

      <description>We are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole of this scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm. His actors, spurred on by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to listen to it. He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public.</description>

      <description>In the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute Coppenole’s idea. Bourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work. The little chapel situated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the grinning match. A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads. In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion.</description>

      <description>While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by the side of a fox. His felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on the velvet and silk which surrounded him.</description>

      <description>Poor Gringoire! the din of all the great double petards of the Saint-Jean, the discharge of twenty arquebuses on supports, the detonation of that famous serpentine of the Tower of Billy, which, during the siege of Paris, on Sunday, the twenty-sixth of September, 1465, killed seven Burgundians at one blow, the explosion of all the powder stored at the gate of the Temple, would have rent his ears less rudely at that solemn and dramatic moment, than these few words, which fell from the lips of the usher, “His eminence, Monseigneur the Cardinal de Bourbon.</description>
